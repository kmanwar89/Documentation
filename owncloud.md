Prereq: Ubuntu 14.04 Server with LAMP Stack, phpMyAdmin already installed

Navigate to web page of phpMyAdmin and create a database, call it ‘owncloud’
Utf8_bin for collation
Navigate to <url/owncloud> for setup page
Leave data folder as default
Set database as mysql and use credentials from earlier
Originally got an error about permissions on the ‘config’ folder, reboot solved this.
Install desktop client on windows
Enter URL of server on windows, works perfectly
On Mint….getting an error about connection refused.
Have to install client from website
